            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>I was working over the weekend at Dave &amp; Busters in Daly City. As a game technician, my job is to cater to the needs of our guests as they come. Usually, the help comes in the form of fixing a game if it doesn't work properly. In my own experience, I make sure that our guests are treated well and have a great experience. Mostly every time, the guests are extremely pleased and grateful for my help.</strong><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>This past weekend, there was this mother and son. The son was about 9 years old and they had an issue with a prize they had won. The prize was a watch and when they had won it, the face of their watch had cracked. As I always do, I reassured them that I would take care of them and went ahead and brought out 4 different watches to choose from as a replacement of the damaged one. As I presented them and asked the boy which one he wanted, his response not only amazed me, but almost made me tear up inside.</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>He said..</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>"Mom, which one do you want?"</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>It went back and forth several times, but the boy always responded in the interest of choosing the watch his mom wanted. Even when the mom shared which two she likes, she too persisted in asking her son to choose which watch he likes. After I assured him not to worry and to choose which one he likes, he eventually chose one.</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>After he chose a watch, I offered the mother a watch as well. She couldn't decide which of the two, a silver one or a pink one, that she liked and wanted to pick. Because I admired the thoughts of her son, which I feel had to have come from how his mother raised him, I presented her with both watches. She was extremely grateful and immediately mentioned how her daughter would love to have one of the watches.</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Now in this point in my mind I've witnessed that the son is putting his mom first, and now the mom is thinking about her daughter. So... I gave the fourth watch as well. The emotion of the mom was priceless and one I will never forget.</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>This is one of those moments why I love my job so much. I am getting paid to make people happy. I feel like Ellen Degeneres! I could just imagine how much it feels to present money to deserving people like Ellen does. While I don't give away money, I give away fun and make sure that every guest I can help gets treated the best I can. What makes this story even more special is while I helped this mother and son with their game and prize, in the end, the mother and son has given to me the hope and faith that humanity still exists and will continue to.</strong></div></div>
